        Everyone wants to live a healthier, more productive life—yet many of us struggle with the same destructive behaviors day after day. From mindless snacking to procrastination, bad habits can feel impossible to break. Luckily, research in behavioral science shows that with the right mindset and consistent strategies, it’s entirely possible to stop bad habits for good.

      <h2 class="block-title">Why Breaking Bad Habits Is So Difficult</h2>
      <p>Habits form because our brains are wired to save energy by automating routine tasks. When we repeatedly engage in a behavior—say, scrolling on social media whenever we’re bored—the brain links that action to cues (boredom = social media). Over time, breaking this loop can be daunting because it requires conscious effort to override a deeply ingrained pattern. Factors like stress, cravings, or environmental triggers often undermine our willpower.</p>
      <p>However, just because it's challenging doesn't mean it's impossible. By recognizing triggers, setting clear goals, and leveraging accountability, you can replace bad habits with healthier alternatives.</p>

      <h2 class="block-title">Common Types of Bad Habits</h2>
      <ol class="custom-list">
        <li><strong>Bad Eating Habits:</strong> Start by identifying what triggers your cravings—emotions, stress, or convenience. Plan healthy snacks and practice mindful eating.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Media or Screen Addiction:</strong> Implement no-screen periods or use screen-limiting apps. Your brain will slowly adjust to life without constant notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>Procrastination:</strong> Break large tasks into smaller chunks and reward yourself upon completion. Try time-blocking or the Pomodoro Technique.</li>
        <li><strong>Nail Biting & Other Nervous Habits:</strong> Keep a stress ball or use a rubber band on your wrist to distract yourself.</li>
        <li><strong>Oversleeping / Late-Night Routines:</strong> Stick to a sleep schedule and place your alarm across the room to avoid snoozing.</li>

      <ul class="custom-list">
        <li><strong>Awareness & Habit Tracking:</strong> Record your habit loop—time, location, mood. Look for patterns over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Setting Clear Goals & Rewards:</strong> Replace vague goals like “I'll stop snacking” with “No food after 8PM for 5 days.” Reward yourself when successful.</li>
        <li><strong>Replacing the Habit:</strong> Substitute the behavior instead of quitting cold. Gum instead of candy. A walk instead of doomscrolling.</li>
        <li><strong>Accountability & Support:</strong> Ask a friend to check in or use a wearable like Pavlok to create real-time feedback loops.</li>
