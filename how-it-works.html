      <h2 class="block-title">How Pavlok Works: The Shockingly Smart Way to Break Bad Habits</h2>
      <p>
        Pavlok is not your average wearable. It doesn’t just count your steps or measure your heart rate—it helps you break bad habits using science-backed feedback techniques like vibration, beep, and yes—mild electric shock. But how exactly does it work? Let’s break it down.

      <h3 class="block-title">The Science Behind Pavlok</h3>
      <p>
        At its core, Pavlok is based on the concept of aversion therapy. This psychological principle suggests that pairing a negative stimulus—like a mild shock—with an unwanted behavior can help you associate that behavior with discomfort, so eventually, you avoid it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you want to stop nail biting, you can set Pavlok to deliver a small electric pulse every time the behavior occurs. Over time, your brain begins to recognize that habit as something unpleasant, which helps you break it.

      <h3 class="block-title">How Does Pavlok Work?</h3>
      <p>
        Pavlok works through a combination of sensors, app input, and user interaction. When you notice yourself engaging in a habit—or when the device detects certain motion patterns—it triggers a gentle yet noticeable stimulus through the wristband.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pavlok wristband pairs with a mobile app where you can set goals, schedule reminders, and track your progress. You can choose from various feedback types: a vibration to nudge you, a beep to alert you, or a zap to capture your attention.

      <h3 class="block-title">What’s Inside the Device?</h3>
      <p>
        Pavlok is equipped with a compact module that includes a battery, a Bluetooth chip, and a feedback delivery system. The device is designed to provide a mild, safe shock that is fully customizable to match your comfort level. Although the shock typically uses between 150–450 volts, it has a low current, making it more of a quick snap than a harmful jolt.
