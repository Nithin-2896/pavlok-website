      <p>
        Pavlok is not your typical wearable. Beyond tracking steps and sleep, it helps you break bad habits through real‑time feedback like vibrations, beeps, and gentle shocks.

      <h2 class="block-title">How Does Pavlok Work?</h2>
      <p>
        Based on aversion therapy, Pavlok pairs negative feedback with undesired behaviors. For instance, triggering a light zap each time you bite your nails conditions your brain to associate the habit with discomfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        The device syncs with a mobile app where you can schedule habits, track progress, and adjust feedback intensity—choosing between vibration, beep, or shock based on your personal goals.
      </p>

    <section class="content-block">
      <h2 class="block-title">What's Inside the Device?</h2>
      <p>
        Pavlok contains a battery, Bluetooth module, and a customizable feedback system. The mild zap is safe due to its low current, and its intensity can be adjusted from subtle reminders to more noticeable alerts.
      </p>
      <h3 class="sub-title">How Effective is Pavlok?</h3>
      <p>
        Thousands of users have leveraged Pavlok to quit smoking, cut down on screen time, or beat procrastination. Its effectiveness lies in enhancing self-awareness and reinforcing behavior change.

      <p>
        The second-generation Pavlok features longer battery life, improved Bluetooth stability, better gesture detection, and refined shock calibration—making it even more efficient in helping you change habits.
      </p>

      <h2 class="block-title">Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Pavlok works by providing immediate, tailored feedback that disrupts negative behavior patterns. This real‑time intervention encourages you to break unwanted habits before they become ingrained.
