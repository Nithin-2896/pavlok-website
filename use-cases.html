      </p>

      <h2 class="block-title">Quit Addictive Habits with Pavlok</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Stop Smoking:</strong> One of Pavlok’s most powerful features is its ability to break physical addictions like smoking. Users who struggle with nicotine dependency find that traditional methods aren’t enough. With Pavlok, each time a user picks up a cigarette, a small zap is administered. This aversive feedback helps the brain associate smoking with discomfort rather than relief—eventually reducing cravings. Many users report successfully cutting down or quitting entirely within a few weeks of consistent use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sugar & Junk Food Control:</strong> Cravings for sugary snacks and fast food are a real challenge. Pavlok provides instant feedback when you reach for that candy bar or soda. Whether you’re dealing with emotional eating or late-night bingeing, Pavlok acts like a coach on your wrist to help reduce impulsive snacking.

      <p>
        <strong>Stop Nail Biting:</strong> Nail biting is one of the most common nervous habits. Often, it happens unconsciously while watching TV, working, or driving. Using motion detection, Pavlok can sense when your hand moves toward your mouth and deliver a subtle buzz or shock, helping you become more aware of your triggers.
      </p>
      <!-- H3: Wake Up On Time with Shock Clock -->
      <h3 class="sub-title">Wake Up On Time with Shock Clock</h3>
      <p>
        The Shock Clock is a game-changer for heavy sleepers. Unlike traditional alarms that are snoozed repeatedly, Pavlok combines vibration, sound, and zap to physically wake you up. Users claim that after just a few days, their body adjusts to waking up earlier—often with no shock needed.

      <p>
        <strong>Reduce Social Media Usage:</strong> We all know the struggle: opening one message and ending up scrolling for hours. Pavlok, paired with browser extensions or mobile apps, delivers a jolt when you access social media—helping to reduce screen time and encourage healthier digital habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Improve Focus & Productivity:</strong> If distractions hinder your work or studies, Pavlok can help by redirecting your attention. It can be set to vibrate if you go idle, stray from tasks, or open distracting apps—thus reinforcing periods of deep focus.

      <p>
        <strong>Fitness Motivation:</strong> Some users use Pavlok to maintain an active lifestyle. By setting goals like 10,000 steps a day or regular gym check-ins, Pavlok rewards positive behavior and provides a gentle zap when you skip workouts—making fitness a fun, gamified experience.

        <em>“Social media was draining hours of my time. Pavlok gave me that wake-up call I needed—literally.” – Marcus, 31</em>

      <p>
        Pavlok uses aversion therapy—a behavioral psychology technique in which an unpleasant stimulus is paired with an unwanted behavior. Over time, this breaks the association, replacing bad habits with new, healthier routines. Beyond simply zapping you, Pavlok builds self-awareness and discipline, empowering you to reclaim your habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start small, stay consistent, and transform your life. Pavlok isn’t magic—it’s science, accountability, and consistency rolled into one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explore how Pavlok can work for your unique situation. Whether your goal is improving health, sharpening focus, or restructuring your daily routine, there’s a use case for everyone.
